Version control = A version control system (VCS) provides an automatic way to
track changes in the software projects, giving creators the power to view 
the previous versions and changes.

> which git == for checking if the git executable is there or not 
> git --version == for checking the version of the git


when we first install the git into the system then we have to do some global setup 
to configure the git, run the following commands.

> git config --global user.name "some name"
> git config --global user.email "some email"
> git config --global init.defaultBranch main 

the third command sets the default git branch to the name as the main,
which is recommended by the community.

> git status =- for checking the status of the current repo

Untracked = this means that currently the git is not tracking the files 
which are shown under the untracked label, for tracking this files we have 
to make use of the git add command.

Staging area = staging area is the area in which the we will put those files 
which we are sure that we will commit into the repo. 

> git add -A == for adding all the files in the staging area 

Untracked/Unstaged ----> Staged ----> Local Repository ----> Remote Repository
Commit = commit is like for finally commiting a version to the repo 

> git commit -m "Some message" == for commiting the files to the repo
> git log == for seeing the log of our commits


All the commits in the git are identified by the hash function which is unique 
every time as it is created by the SHA algorithm.
