HTML = Hyper text markup language 
it decides the content of the web or the structure of the web page

CSS = Cascading style sheets 
it decides the styles and layout of the webpage 

Javascript
Javascript is for the interactivity 

Webpages should be forward compatible, it has to be resilient in changes in the 
technology, as all the browsers run the web. 

After we write the HTML, the browser will create the document object tree, or the 
document object model for working and manipulating with the html markup tree. Based 
on the DOM tree the browser will also create and accessibility tree. 

## HTML Tags 
<p></p> == Paragraph tags

<h1></h1> == Headlines when we go to h1 to h6 the font size will decrease

<i></i> == this is for only the visual italics 
<em></em> == for the semantic or human emphasize (provided by the designers)

<b></b> == this is for the visual bolding
<strong></strong> == it is like semantic or human strong meaning


## Lists in the HTML 
1. ordered lists 
2. unordered lists 
3. definition lists 

<li> stands for the list items

<ul> = for the unordered lists
<ol> = for the ordered lists

By default the ordered lists will list the items with the numbered items, but we can 
here give the type attribute so that we can give the different types. 

- a for lowercase letters 
- A for uppercase 
- i for lower romman letters 
- I for upper roman letters 
- 1 for the numbered lists

Here we can also put the key value term list where we want to pair the key and 
its description so that design terms it can get grouped. 

<dl> = for the definition list 
<dt> = for the definition term 
<dd> = for the description of the key term

<dl>
    <dt>
        <dd></dd>
    </dt>
</dl>

<q> tag for quoting the tags inline 
<blockquote> for the blocks context and quoting

<time datetime="some dating format">put here date in any format</time>
The machine readable format for the date and the 
time is YYYY-MM-DD. (Look more into docs)


HTML Entities 
&lt == <
&gt == > 
&amp == &
&nbsp == non breaking space

Non breaking spaces are useful when we want some words separated by the spaces to 
be displayed together always. 

<code> tag for writing something code 
<br> this is the break line
<pre> this is element is for respecting the spaces in the content, as the HTML wraps 
the white spaces and the content, we can make use of the pre element and it will 
respect the whitespaces. 

<sub> for the subscript 
<sup> for the superscript
<small> for putting the text as lower importance


aria roles provides the accessibe information about the specific element. this is 
useful to make sure that the functionality of the web aplication is fuly accessible to 
everyone. 

sometimes in the accessibility purposes, the accessibility tree does not result in 
something we want.

<h1>
    <div>
        <span>H</span>
        <span>i</span>
        <span>i</span>
    <div>
</h1> 

In normal accessibility tree it will be read as the H, I, I but we have to read it 
as Hii for that we can make use of the aria properties. 

we can give the aria-label to the parent element, and we can group all the child 
and then give them aria-hidden = true, this will remove that element and all of 
its children from the acessibility tree. 

give <h1 aria-label="Hii">
<div aria-hidden=true>

<a href="some hyper link">some text</a> = anchor tag
absolute URL has https in the href
HTTP = Hyper text transfer protocol

SVG = Scalable vector graphics

In the image tag when we give the srcset attribute and we will have to list their 
many different wide pixel images, then the browser will automatically decide which 
is the best picture that needs to be displayed in the screen. 

we can wrap the image element in the figure tag and we can give the caption with the 
figcaption element to the image tag. 

we can also make use of the subtitles for the video, for doing that we have to put the 
track element inside the video tag and point to the subtitles file, it will have the 
subtitle option in the video, we can also give the labels and default parameter for 
making the subtitle default and all. 

But it is not recommended to use the video and the audio elements like this rather 
we should use the iframe or make use of the embedding of the other video or audio 
elements, it is more recommended.The reason behind this is html elements does 
not support adaptive bit rate streaming. 

we can also tell the computer what is the content written in the language, we can 
specify it by using the lang attribute, and we can make use of the charset UTF-8 which 
is the modern charset which has almost each and every character. we can also 
tell the computer how the langage should be read like left to right or right to left.

the title in the head tag is the text which will be get displayed when someone bookmarks 
the website.
