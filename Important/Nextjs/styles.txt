For adding the global styles to the web app we have to 
add the styles inside the _app file.

import "./styles/globals.css"

we can also make use of the bootstrap inside the _app file.

we can make the component level styles also, by making the file 
name Component.module.css 

and importing it as
import styles from "./something"
and we can make use of the classname as styles.className
