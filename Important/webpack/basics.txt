why we need webpack?
For a web project we can make two ways to load the script files, like 
we can make too many script files but this can be resulted in network 
bottleneck, while we can also create one big js script file but this can 
lead to scope, size, readability, maintainability. 

webpack runs on the node.js which is the javascript runtime that can be used 
in computers and servers to run the scripts outside the browsers. 

webpack is the module bundler and it is a helper tool which we can configure 
as per our needs. 



## the main difference between dynamic import and static import 
The main difference between the static import and the dynamic import is that 
when we use the static import in a file, when the file is get loaded, the 
code for the imported module will also be downloaded immediately, but in the 
dynamic imports it will only be doownloaded when we do some action. 

import(filename).then({default,namedExport}=>{

}) // we can access the properties like this
