> Node.js 
The main goal of the node.js is that it is the javascript runtime environment 
without the browser engine. So for executing the javascript we have to 
install the node.js.

> yarn vs npm 
yarn installs the packages parallely while the npm does it sequentially, so 
yarn is faster in time.

> json 
javascript object notation = A text based data format following 
javascript object syntax 

Standard text based format for representing the structured data 
based on javascript object syntax commonly used for transmitting the 
data across the web 

JSON Exists as a string = useful when we want to transmit the data 
for accessing the data we have to make use of the json format 

JSON.stringify(js object) = returns the json string 
JSON.parse(json string) = returns the javascript object

in the parse function we can also have the traversal function which 
can be used to transform the parsed output 
json.parse(json string,(key,val)=>{
    do some computation on value 
    return value;
})

when the server sends the response it will be the stringified json 
we have to convert it into the json. so we have to make use of the json parse 
method. 



> window vs document 
basically in the webpages the window is the global execution context and the 
main global root element, while the document is the object which contains the 
parsed html document, document will help to manipulate the DOM, while window has 
the properties such as url history, location and href, navigator, setTimeOut and all. there is also another
object which is screen, screen contains the physical details about the display 
such as width height and all. Also fror accessing any property of the window
we do not have to write the window. as it is the global object we can 
directly write the property name.
