## Variables in css 
Variables in css can have both local and the global scope, if the variable 
is defined inside the :root selector it will have the global scope and it 
can be accessed within the whole document, while the local variable
should be declared inside the individual selector in which we are gonna use.

:root{
    --blue:#000000;
    --white:#000000;
}

p{
    background-color:var(--blue);
}

## calc function in css 
we can make use of the calc function in the css for calculation.
height: calc(some expression here)


## scss is nothing but the sassy css, where it has some more extension 
over the plain css. 

## tailwind css is like the bootstrap, where the classes are predefined 
and we just have to use them.
