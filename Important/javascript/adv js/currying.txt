Currying is an advanced technique of working with the functions. 
It is not only used in javascript but is also used in the other 
languages also. 

currying is basically the transformation of the functions that 
converts the call f(a,b,c) into f(a)(b)(c)

function fn(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

function curry(fn){
    return function(a){
        return function(b){
            return fn(a,b)
        }
    }
}

let curriedSum = curry(fn)
console.log(curriedSum(a)(b))


Why we need currying?
