> Graph QL  (Net ninja GraphQL tut)
It is a querry language, allows more flexible and efficient approach than REST
Let say we are developing the book website than,

for fetching the particular book based on the id we have to create the endpoint 
domain.com/books/:id

for fetching the author 
domain.com/authors/:id

this can be done with the one request in GraphQL 
{
    book(id:123){
        title
        genere
        reviews
        author{
            name
            bio
            books{
                name
            }
        }
    }
}


what happens behind the scenes?
As compared to the REST architecture we do not have to worry about making 
too many endpoints, rather we create one end point where we map the data 
on the graph, and based on the frontend querry we land on particular node of
data and then we can traverse the graph based on the data needs. 

GraphQL is the database?
GraphQL is the querry language not a database, it has nothing to do with where 
we store the data, it is just the query language, it map the data stored in the 
remote database. 

Graphiql?
It is just the dummy frontend which can test the graphQL server.
