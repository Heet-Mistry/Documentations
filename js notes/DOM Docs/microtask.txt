Rendering never happens while the engine is executing the task, it does not matter 
if the task takes long time. Changes in the DOM only painted after the task is 
complete. 

If a task takes too long, the browser can’t do other tasks, such as processing user 
events. So after a time, it raises an alert like “Page Unresponsive”, suggesting 
killing the task with the whole page. That happens when there are a lot of complex 
calculations or a programming error leading to an infinite loop.


Immediately after every macrotask, the engine executes all tasks from microtask 
queue, prior to running any other macrotasks or rendering or anything else.

Here, when there are any task in the micro task then the rendering will not 
happen here.
