The lifecycle of the html pgase has three important parts. 
DOMContentLoaded = the browser fully loaded and the HTML tree is fully built
but external resources like img and media may not have been loaded

load = not only the html but also the content in it like img and all are 
also loaded

beforeunload/unload = when the user is leaving the page 



DOMContentLoaded event – DOM is ready, so the handler can lookup DOM nodes, 
initialize the interface.

load event – external resources are loaded, so styles are applied, image 
sizes are known etc.

beforeunload event – the user is leaving: we can check if the user saved the 
changes and ask them whether they really want to leave.

unload – the user almost left, but we still can initiate some operations, 
such as sending out statistics.


1. DOMContentLoaded
this event happens on the document object. we can attach the event listener to it.

<script>
  function ready() {
    alert('DOM is ready');
    // image is not yet loaded (unless it was cached), so the size is 0x0
    alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`);
  }
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready);
</script>
<img id="img" src="https://en.js.cx/clipart/train.gif?speed=1&cache=0">


Scripts that do not block the DOMContentLoaded
- the async scripts do not block the DOMContentLoaded
- scripts that are dynamically added the DOMContentLoaded does not wait for it


<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script>
  // the script doesn't execute until the stylesheet is loaded
  alert(getComputedStyle(document.body).marginTop);
</script>

but te DOMContentLoaded does not wait for the styles, but in this case because the 
script is waiting for the css, the DOMContentLoaded will wait for it. 

NOTE:
In some browsers there is functionlity of the autofill the page, which happens 
due to the DOMContentLoaded, due to some long runing scripts this can delay. 


> window.onload 
The load event on the window object triggers when the whole page is loaded 
including styles, images and other resources. This event is available via the 
onload property.

> window.unload 
When a visitor leaves the page, the unload event triggers on window. 
We can do something there that doesn’t involve a delay, like closing related 
popup windows.

usecase 
it can be helpful when we want to give the analytics data to the server after the 
user leaves the page. 

> window.onbeforeunload 
If a visitor initiated navigation away from the page or tries to close the window, 
the beforeunload handler asks for additional confirmation.


document.readyState 
this property tells about the current loading state
loading = document is loading 
interactive = document was fully read 
complete = the document is fully read and the resources are loaded too

there is also one readyStatechange event that tells about the change in the state.
document.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => console.log(document.readyState));


window.load = runs after all the other load handlers
interactive and DOMContentLoaded is the same thing 
complete and window.onload is the same thing






















** async and defer **
What browser does is, when the browser finds the script tag then it will stop 
rendering the DOM, and start to execute the script. This also happens 
with the external scripts, the browser must have to script to download and then 
it has to execute it. 

This is called the content blocking, in which the html content loading is 
blocked for executing the script. 

one solution is that we can put the script tag at the end of the html document 
but it has its own downsides, such as for the large html documents, the browser 
will take more time to execute the script, so it can be a delay. 


defer = the defer tag tells the browser that the script will be loaded parallely 
in the background, and after the DOM is fully built then and only then the 
script will be executed. \

NOTE:
DOMContentLoaded event fires when the html document has been fully parsed and 
all defered scripts are downloaded and executed, it doesn't wait for other things 
like images and subframes and async scripts. 

<p>...content before scripts...</p>
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => alert("DOM ready after defer!"));
</script>
<script defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></script>
<p>...content after scripts...</p>

- first the content will be displayed 
- then the long script will execute 
- and then the DOMContentLoaded event will fire

NOTE:
defer attribute is only for the external scripts.



async = load the script in the background and run when its ready
- the browser does not block on async scripts 
- other scripts do not wait for async and async do not wait for them 
- DOMContentLoaded does not wait for the async to complete


NOTE:
In the case of the defer the, relatve order of the scripts are maintained 
and even if they are loaded they do not directly executed, but in the case of the 
async it does not matter, whichever loads first it will be executed. 

In the async it will be downloaded parallely and when it is ready it will block the 
page parsing. 


We can also add the scripts to the page with one another mthod which s called the 
dynamic scripts.

let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "/article/script-async-defer/long.js";
document.body.append(script); // (*)

The script starts loading as soon as it’s appended to the document (*).

NOTE: Dynamic scripts behave as the async by default.
we can change this by doing like script.async = false; then the scripts will be 
executed in the document order. 


** Resource loading onload onerror **
There are some events for us to track the loading of the resources.

onload - successfuly load 
onerror - error occurred


usecase 
let say we are dynamically appending one script in the document, and we want to 
execute the function when the script is loaded, then we have to make use of the 
onload and such events. 

onload = fires when the script is loaded and executed

let script = document.createElement('script');
// can load any script, from any domain
script.src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.3.0/lodash.js"
document.head.append(script);

script.onload = function() {
  // the script creates a variable "_"
  alert( _.VERSION ); // shows library version
};


onerror = errors that occur during the loading of the script can be tracked with in 
an error event. 

let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "https://example.com/404.js"; // no such script
document.head.append(script);
script.onerror = function() {
  alert("Error loading " + this.src); // Error loading https://example.com/404.js
};

NOTE:
The execution errors can not be handled with the onload and onerror, onerror just 
check for the loading error and onload checks for the loading and execution even if 
there are errors. 

All the variables will be accessible in the onload. 

the load and the error events also works in the case of the img elements and the 
other resources, the img element is an exception because, in the case of the images 
it will start loading when we provide the src attribute. iframe.onload event 
trigers when the loading is finished, both for the successful loading and the in case
of the error. 


cross origin policy 
The site from the one domain can not access the resources from the another domain.
