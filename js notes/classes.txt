classes basic syntax 

class Myclass{
    constructor(){}
    methods1(){}
}

class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }
}

// Usage:
let user = new User("John");
user.sayHi();

In javascipt class is basically a function. typeof className will give the type function.

what class className{} really does is that, it creates a function named classnAME AND 
then the body of the function will be the constructor code. and stores all the 
methods of the class in the className.prototype.



class User {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
}

// class is a function
alert(typeof User); // function

// ...or, more precisely, the constructor method
alert(User === User.prototype.constructor); // true

// The methods are in User.prototype, e.g:
alert(User.prototype.sayHi); // the code of the sayHi method

// there are exactly two methods in the prototype
alert(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype)); // constructor, sayHi


NOTE: 
We can not call the class directly , we have to call the class using the new Syntax.
All code inside the classes is automatically in the strict mode. 


Dynamic class creation
function makeClass(phrase) {
  // declare a class and return it
  return class {
    sayHi() {
      alert(phrase);
    }
  };
}

// Create a new class
let User = makeClass("Hello");

new User().sayHi(); // Hello


we can also put the getter and the setters inside the class definition. we can also 
put some class fields inside the classes, the main difference here is that, the 
fields are not stored inside the prototype it will be created inside the individual 
objects. 


class User {
  name = "John";
}

let user = new User();
alert(user.name); // John
alert(User.prototype.name); // undefined


this are dynamic in the javascript, so if the object methods is passed around and 
called in the different context then, it will not point to that object anymore.

we can bind the this inside the calsses by first function binding,or we can make the 
method as the class fields, in the methods which are the class fields, the this 
pointer always remain bound. 

class Button {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  click = () => {
    alert(this.value);
  }
}
let button = new Button("hello");
setTimeout(button.click, 1000); // hello


NOTE 
Even if the default methods pass their this inside the callbacks, the arrow 
function will not accept that this.


*** class Inheritance ***
class Child extends Parent
when we write the extends keyword then what happens is js manipulates the [[prototype]]
hidden property. 

we can also override the methods inside the child, so that it can take the overriden 
method, we can also call the parent methods from the child method by doing like 

super.method() for calling the parent methods 
super() for calling the super constructor

ARROW FUNCTION DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPER 

class Rabbit extends Animal {
  stop() {
    setTimeout(() => super.stop(), 1000); // call parent stop after 1sec
  }
}
here the arrow takes the super of the parent function stop()


if the class does not have the constructor, then the empty constructor is automatically 
created like 

constructor(...args){
    super(...args)
}

NOTE:
Before using the this the child class has to call the super(). 


whenwe have the constructor in the child class what happens is when we call it 
with the new then it will, create the this with an empty object. but in the case of 
when the child does not have the constructor, it does not do that. so we have to 
call the super method. 

the parent constructor always uses the parent class's field. the reason behind 
this is, the child class fields are initialized before the constructor for the base 
class and after super() for the derived class. 



Super internals [[Home object]]
sometimes in the chain when we access the property of the super classes then 
it can someime end up in the endless loop because of the this pointer. so for working 
with this the js provides one more special internal property for functions 
which is [[Homeobject]].

When a function is specified as a class or object method, its 
[[HomeObject]] property becomes that object. so basically the [[HomeObject]]
Provides the mechanism for handling the this.


let animal = {
  name: "Animal",
  eat() {         // animal.eat.[[HomeObject]] == animal
    alert(`${this.name} eats.`);
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  __proto__: animal,
  name: "Rabbit",
  eat() {         // rabbit.eat.[[HomeObject]] == rabbit
    super.eat();
  }
};

let longEar = {
  __proto__: rabbit,
  name: "Long Ear",
  eat() {         // longEar.eat.[[HomeObject]] == longEar
    super.eat();
  }
};

// works correctly
longEar.eat();  // Long Ear eats.

we can not change the [[HomeObject]].

Here the [[HomeObject]] is the property of the function object method. and the 
method inside the js is not free. each and every methods has its own [[HomeObject]]
, we can copy the method inside another object if that methods does not uses the 
super(), if it uses the super() then it will give wrong results. 


the [[HomeObject]] is only set for the methods written as method(){} not like 
method:(){} it will not work in that case, if we use super. 


we can also create the static methods inside the classes, those methods are 
defined for the whole class, it is same as defining the property. we can create the 
static method by just putting the static keyword at the start of the method. 

the static methods are generally used for making the constructors.

class Article {
  constructor(title, date) {
    this.title = title;
    this.date = date;
  }

  static createTodays() {
    // remember, this = Article
    return new this("Today's digest", new Date());
  }
}
let article = Article.createTodays();
alert( article.title ); // Today's digest

In the static method the this is the same as the className.

we have to call the static methods with teh classname, the static methods are not 
available for the individual objects. we can also create the static properties.     


class Article {
  static publisher = "Ilya Kantor";
}
alert( Article.publisher ); // Ilya Kantor

the static methods are inheritable, 


when we create the satic methods and properties then, what happens is it creates 
two prototypical behaviour in which there is a link between the constructor functions 
itself and also a link between the prototype of the constructor function. 


internal properties = properties and methods that are accessible from the inside 
only 

external properties = properties and methods that are accessible also from the 
outside

protected values are those which have the underscore at the front. it is just the 
common convention in the programming. when we want the control over setting the 
properties of the classes, we can make use of the getter and the setter, and 
in the getter and the setter always set the values with the underscore variable.


class CoffeeMachine {
  _waterAmount = 0;
  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) {
      value = 0;
    }
    this._waterAmount = value;
  }
  get waterAmount() {
    return this._waterAmount;
  }
  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

// add water
coffeeMachine.waterAmount = -10; // _waterAmount will become 0, not -10


we can also make the property readonly
class CoffeeMachine {
  // ...

  constructor(power) {
    this._power = power;
  }

  get power() {
    return this._power;
  }

}

// create the coffee machine
let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);
alert(`Power is: ${coffeeMachine.power}W`); // Power is: 100W
coffeeMachine.power = 25; // Error (no setter)


## NOTE ##
protected fields are inheritated, unlike the private ones


if we want to make the variable or the property private then, we have to create the 
variable with appending the # before it. the private property will not any conflict 
with the public one. we can have both public and private property of the same name;




*** class checking instance of ***
obj instanceOf class = returns true if the obj is the object of the class

normally the nstanceOf checks the whole inheritance chain for the checking of the 
relationship, but we can alter the definition by creting the static method 

static [Symbol.hasInstance](obj){
    custom logic
}

instanceOf just cheks the prototype of the functions.
