JS Engine only alows 10,000 recursion calls. 

The information about the process of execution of the runing function is 
stored inside the execution context. It is like an internal data structure that 
contains the details about the execution of the function. 

If we have the nested calls, then what happens is that, the main execution context 
will be remembered in the execution context stack, and another execution context 
for the new function is created and then it will start executing, after that the 
main ne will be retrieved and then it will execute.
