*** Modules in javascript ***

export function func(){}
import {func} from './module script path';

when we import the script as the module then we have to explicitely tell the 
browser to treat the script as the module, by <script type="module">

Modules are by default defered in javascript.
 
- modules always work in the strict mode (assigning to undeclared variable gives error) 
- The modules code will be evaluated only the first time it is imported
  after that no matter how many times we import it it will take the same 
  executed script
- In a module this will be undefined this is due to the strict mode

we can tie a variable to the window object for making it global 
by doing like window.varname = some var, then each and every script will be 
able to see it. 

import.meta contains the information about the module. 
such as import.meta.url 

if we import the scripts in the plain HTML then, we have to make sure that 
we import it in the correct order. because, they are executed in the same order 
they are put in the document. 

for the non module scripts the async attribute works only in the external scripts,
not on the inline scripts. In the module scripts, the async works also in the 
inline scripts = the usecase here is when the script is not dependent on anything 
like ads and all. 

if we put two script with the same src in the html document, then it will run only once
when the type is the module. 

also the bare modules are not allowed, we have to put some path or url for the import 
statement. 

<script type="module">
  alert("Runs in modern browsers");
</script>

<script nomodule>
  alert("Modern browsers know both type=module and nomodule, so skip this")
  alert("Old browsers ignore script with unknown type=module, but execute this.");
</script>
// usecase is when old browser does not understand the module scripts

unused exports removed = tree shaking
minification = spaces removed and all, variables replaced with the shorter names
unreachanble code is removed
converting the bleeding edge js to simple = babel transpiler 

if we use the bundler then the import and the exports are converted into special 
bundler function, and all the files are combined into one single blob which we 
can then import in the website. 

<script src="bundle.js"></script>


if the app is working in the older browser then maybe we want to put some message 
then we have to enclose it inside the <script nomodule> tag.

for exporting the modules or variables we can do it by the list like 
function a(){}
function b(){}

export {a,b}
import {a,b} from './asd';
import * as obj from './asd';

generally it is recommended that we do not use the wildcard import or the export.
Modern build tools bundles the modules together and optimize them for speedup 
loading and it will remove the unused stuff, this is called the tree shaking.

// import as 
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';
hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!

// export as 
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
import * as say from './say.js';
say.hi('John'); // Hello, John!
say.bye('John'); // Bye, John!

const a = 5;
export default a;
import a from './asd';

when we have the default export then we can import them using any name it does 
not matter there.

export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

import {default as User, sayHi} from './user.js';
// also in the wildcard import the default will be the obj.default.

we can reexport something like 
export {something} from './asd';
export {default as user} from './asf' // it is just the another notation for 
the importing and then exporting

export * from './user.js'
this will ignore the default export so we have to explicitely export them

for reexporting the default export we have to do it like 
export {default} from './asd';


NOTE : import and the exports should be at the top, it should not be the nested.

>> Dynamic imports 
The export and import path in the static imports and exports can only be the strings. 
the path also can not be the function call. also we can not import conditionally at 
the run time. 

import(module) // dynamic syntax 

here this syntax loads the module and returns the promise which resolves into the 
module, and we can use it. 

export function hi() {
  alert(`Hello`);
}

export function bye() {
  alert(`Bye`);
}

let {hi, bye} = await import('./say.js');
hi();
bye();


// for the default exports
let obj = await import('./say.js');
let say = obj.default;
// or, in one line: let {default: say} = await import('./say.js');
say();


Dynamic exports work in the regular scripts, they do not require script type="module"
import() it is not the function call, it is a special syntax


<!doctype html>
<script>
  async function load() {
    let say = await import('./say.js');
    say.hi(); // Hello!
    say.bye(); // Bye!
    say.default(); // Module loaded (export default)!
  }
</script>
<button onclick="load()">Click me</button>


let modulePath = prompt("Which module to load?");
import(modulePath)
  .then(obj => <module object>)
  .catch(err => <loading error, e.g. if no such module>)
