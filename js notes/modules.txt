*** Modules in javascript ***

export function func(){}
import {func} from './module script path';

when we import the script as the module then we have to explicitely tell the 
browser to treat the script as the module, by <script type="module">

Modules are by default defered in javascript.
 
- modules always work in the strict mode 
- The modules code will be evaluated only the first time it is imported
  after that no matter how many times we import it it will take the same 
  executed script
- In a module this will be undefined 

if the app is working in the older browser then maybe we want to put some message 
then we have to enclose it inside the <script nomodule> tag.

for exporting the modules or variables we can do it by the list like 
function a(){}
function b(){}

export {a,b}
import {a,b} from './asd';
import * as obj from './asd';

generally it is recommended that we do not use the wildcard import or the export.
Modern build tools bundles the modules together and optimize them for speedup 
loading and it will remove the unused stuff, this is called the tree shaking.

// import as 
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';
hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!

// export as 
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
import * as say from './say.js';
say.hi('John'); // Hello, John!
say.bye('John'); // Bye, John!

const a = 5;
export default a;
import a from './asd';

when we have the default export then we can import them using any name it does 
not matter there.

export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

import {default as User, sayHi} from './user.js';
// also in the wildcard import the default will be the obj.default.

we can reexport something like 
export {something} from './asd';
export {default as user} from './asf' // it is just the another notation for 
the importing and then exporting

for reexporting the default export we have to do it like 
export {default} from './asd';


NOTE : import and the exports should be at the top, it should not be the nested.
