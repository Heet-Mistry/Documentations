*** Objects ***
Objects are the data storage for storing the key:value pair in the data.

let obj = new Object(); // object construtor syntax 
let obj = {}; // object litral syntax

obj = {
  name:"dire",
  surname:"localhost"
}

obj.name 
obj.surname

for deleting the property we can make use of the delete operator 
delete obj.name;

we can also use the multiline property names as the key but they should be quoted 
like "some multiline key"

let obj = {
  "full name":"something"
}

for accessing this type of the keys we have to make use of the square bracket 
obj["full name"]

If the key does not exist in the object it will give the undefined if we access it.
also we can give the property name as the variable name for doing that we 
have to make use of the square bracket, this is called the COMPUTED PROPERTIES.

let a = "name";
let obj = {
  [a]:"some name"
}

when we have the key and the value as the same then we can put it in the 
shorthand notation such as, even if we have the key as the object then the 
name of the object will be key as the string. 

let obj = {
  name,
  surname
}

NOTE = In the objects if we give some key as the litral other then the string 
then the given value will be converted to the string by default automatically.
even if we use the number then it will be converted into the string. 

we can not set the __proto__ property of any object to a non object type, it will not 
work. 

null = for unknown and empty values 
undefined = for not defined

For checking if some key exist in the object we can make use of the in operator 
> "key" in obj => true/false ===> it is recommended to check it with this for 
checking if the key exists inside the object or not.

for iterating in the object we can iterate them like 
for(let key in obj){
  log(obj[key]);
}
here it is same for the arrays because arrays are also one sort of objects.

If we store the objects in the integer properties then the keys will be sorted 
but if there are any non integer property then the keys will appear as they 
are listed. And the number properties will be converted into the string. 

One of the main difference between the object and the primitive types is that 
objects are stored as the reference while the primitves are stored as the values.


we can also iterate in the object by doing like 
for(let [k,v] of Object.entries(obj)){
  
}

NOTE = Very Important to note that the objects and arrays are stored as the 
reference where the strings and other primitive types are not. so if we create 
some object and then we assign it to some other and then if we change something 
in the second one then it will also be reflected into the first one.

when we assign some object to the variable then that variable will not be storing 
the object but it will have the value of the address where the object is lying.

let a = {}
let b = {}
a==b ==> false because the reference is different

when the objects are compared with the comparison operator, first the 
objects are converted into the primitives. 

for copying the objects we can iterate over the values and manually assign them. rather 
we can make use of the Object.assign method

Object.assign(dest,...sources)
the dest is the object in which we want to copy the items 
and the sources are the list of the objects from which we want to take the properties.

let user = { name: "John" };
let permissions1 = { canView: true };
let permissions2 = { canEdit: true };

// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);

// now user = { name: "John", canView: true, canEdit: true }
alert(user.name); // John
alert(user.canView); // true
alert(user.canEdit); // true

If the properties already exists, it will be overwritten. the Object.assign returns 
the object also, which is of the same reference of the dest. 

let clone = Object.assign({}, another Object);
it can be used for the shallow copying, but for the deep copy we have to 
iterate over the values and then make use of the clonning everywhere. 

For the nested clonin we have to make use of the structured
let cloned_obj = structuredClone(object)

but this method fails when we have the function property inside the object. 


** Garbage collection in javascript **
The memory management in the javascript happens automatically, the main concept in 
the javascript memory management is reachability. reachable values are those which 
are accessible or usable somehow. they are guranteed to be stored in the memory.

A base set of inherently reachanle values.
- currently executing functions, its variables and parameters
- other function on the current chain 
- global variables 
( these are called the roots )

Any other value is considered reachable if it is rechanble from the root elements.
by reference or the chain of reference. 

For instance, if there’s an object in a global variable, and that object has a 
property referencing another object, that object is considered reachable. And 
those that it references are also reachable. Detailed examples to follow.

There is a background process in the javascript engine which is called the grabage 
collector, it monitores all the objects and removes that has become unreachable.

let user = {
  name:"some name"
}

here the user has the reference to the object, and the property name is inside the 
user, so if we do user = null then, there is no way to access the name property 
so the garbage collector will automatically junks the object. 

the delete operator actually deletes the reference to the object, when the 
object is not needed then it will be deleted by the grabage collector. in simpler 
words we can say that when the object has not incoming links then it will be junked. 
basically one reference point to the other object and the link has the name same 
as the property. 

if we directly override the main reference variable to null then all the 
interlinked references will be lost and junked. 

Garbage collection algorithm = mark and sweep, which is same as the DFS, first we 
will try with the root nodes and mark them and then start to visit their references 
and also mark them, untill every reachable node is marked. then the non rachable will 
be deleted. 

There are some optimizations that garbage collection perform.
1. generational collection = here there are two sets, new ones and the old ones,
in some code some objects have shorter time spans, they appear do their job and die 
, so those who survive for long enough become old and are examined less often. 

2. incremental collection = if there are many objects then the whole set is 
splitted into multiple parts and and clear these parts one after another. 

3. idle time collection = the garbage collection happens when the CPU is idle



*** This pointer in the objects ***
The function which is the property of the object is called the method. OBJECTS
represents the real world entities. 

The value of the this is the object before the dot. The value of the this pointer 
is evaluated at the runtime depending on the context. Rathet then the other 
programming languages the this pointer in the javascript is not bound, it does
not depend on the method where it is created but it is dependent on the method 
where it is called inside the code.

The main pros of the free this is that the function can be reused for the 
different objects. 

Also the arrow function in the javascript have no this. If we use the this inside 
the arrow function then it will take the this from the outer normal function. 
Do not use the arrow function in the object methods where we are using the 
this pointer.

let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};
user.sayHi(); // Ilya



function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}
let user = makeUser();
alert( user.ref.name ); // Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
// Here the ref is created at the makeUser() call so the this, and the this will 
be undefined for this case. 

this == Object itself


** Object construtor syntax **
we can create the objects using the object literal syntax and also we can 
make the object with the function constructor syntax.

function User(name){
  // this = {} // this is the thing that js do actually
  this.name = name;
  this.surname = "some surname";
  // return this; // same thing js do
}

let obj = new User("dhairya")

we can immediately call the function constructor when we have too many lines of code 
and we will not use another time that constructor.

let user = new function() {
  this.name = "John";
  this.isAdmin = false;
  // ...other code for user creation
  // maybe complex logic and statements
  // local variables etc
};

when we execute the function in the new what happens is it will create the 
new empty object and then it will assign it to this and then when the function 
body executes then it will then modifies the this.

we can also check if the function is called with the new or in a simple way 
by doing new.target in the function. if it is called with the new then it will 
give the function itself otherwise it will give the undefined.

function User() {
  alert(new.target);
}
// without "new":
User(); // undefined
// with "new":
new User(); // function User { ... }

The construtor functions do not have the return type as they return the this, if they 
have the return type then there are two rules. 

- if the return type is the object then return the object ad ignore this 
- if the return type is primitive then ignore the return statement

not only the properties we can also make use of the, methods and add the methods 
inside the constructor objects. 


NOTE = Technically any functions can be used as the constructor except the 
arrow function as they do not have the this pointers.
 
** Optional chaining ** ===> ?.
The DOM properties return the null when there is no specified DOM. 

when we do it like obj?.prop?.otherProp ==> it will check each and every 
property in the chain and it will stop when one is undefined or null before the 
?. and it will return the undefined, it will not throw any error.

the optional chaining works for the defined variables only, it will not work 
if any of the variables is not defined. the optional chaining is not an operator 
rather a syntax construct.

we can also make use of this constructs with ?.() and ?.[], here the optional 
chaining is used only for the fetching values, not for the writing values.


for clonning the objects we can use the method assign 
let obj = {
  user:"name",
  surname:"rupala"
}

let clone = Object.assign({},obj, and other objects )
here the first arg is the destination object where we want all the 
property of the other objects should go in. 

for the nested clonning we have to make use of the structuredClone() method 
the assign will not work, as it will work only for the single level copies. 
let clone = structuredClone(user), but it is not recommended to use it 
when the object has the function properties, the method fails so we have to make 
our own code snippet. 


Objects and the this pointer...
In objects we can also directly write the funtion methods without writing the 
function keyword such as 

let user = {
  sayHi(){
    something computation..
  }
}

this can be used to access the property of the same object.

let user = {
  name:"some name",
  sayHi(){
    this.name
  }
}

here the this is computed dynamically, it is
evaluated at run time depending on the context of the  
program it is not always the object it self
when we do the function call such as

user.sayHi() the this will take the objeect before the dot operator. 


let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)


consider the below example 
function sayHi() {
  alert(this);
}
sayHi(); // undefined


here the this is undefined because of the strict mode and, and if the strict mode 
is not on then the this will be the global window object. So if we 
are using this inside a function then it should be called inside the object 
context. 

the arrow functions do not have this, if we use this inside the arrow function 
then it will take the this as the outer function this. 

let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};
user.sayHi(); // Ilya

if directly use it then the this will be the empty object 
let user= {
  name:"dhairya",
  sayHi:()=>{
    log(this) // it will give {}
  }
}


often we need to create many similar type of functions so we need to use 
the function constructor syntax for that, the constructor functions are the 
functions which are the name is capital and they should be executed with the 
new operator. 


generally the global object in the browser environment is defined as the 
window and the global object in the node.js is defined as the global. when we 
declare the var then it will automatically be the part of the global object. same 
goes for the function declaration. 


Evrything in the javascript is a value, and the function is also a value and its 
type is object. 
functions have some properties inbuilt such as name and length.

the func.name gives the name of the function 
func.length gives the nmber of arguments. in the length the rest parameters 
are not counted. 

** Object to primitive conversion **
When we operate over the objects then the objects are converted into the primtive types 
and the operation occurs on that values. 

All objects are true in the boolean context. there can only be the numeric and 
the string conversion in the objects. 

The numeric conversion happens in the case of the mathematical operations,
while the string conversion happens in case of the printing values, such as 
alert(obj) and all. e.g. mathematical operation is like subtracting two date 
objects. 

javascript has its own methods to automatically decide whch conversion to apply.
// output
alert(obj);
// using object as a property key
anotherObj[obj] = 123;
In the above example the string conversion takes place.


// explicit conversion
let num = Number(obj);
// maths (except binary plus)
let n = +obj; // unary plus
let delta = date1 - date2;
// less/greater comparison
let greater = user1 > user2;
Here the numeric conversion takes place. 

default conversion = this takes place when the engine does not know which type 
to choose in the hints to make sure the code works, like binary + can work with both 
the strings and the numbers so, there the default takes place.

if the object is compared with the string number or symbol, it is also unclear 
which conversion should be done, so the default hint is used. 

The greater and less comparison operators, such as < >, can work with both 
strings and numbers too. Still, they use the "number" hint, not "default". 
That’s for historical reasons.

// binary plus uses the "default" hint
let total = obj1 + obj2;
// obj == number uses the "default" hint
if (user == 1) { ... };

For the conversion, javascript tries to call and find the three object methods.
- Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) – the method with the symbolic key 
  Symbol.toPrimitive (system symbol), if such method exists,
- Otherwise if hint is "string" = try calling obj.toString() or obj.valueOf(), 
  whatever exists.
- Otherwise if hint is "number" or "default" = try calling obj.valueOf() or 
  obj.toString(), whatever exists.

There is a built in symbol named Symbol.toPrimitive that should be used for the 
conversion. 

obj[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function(hint) {
  // here goes the code to convert this object to a primitive
  // it must return a primitive value
  // hint = one of "string", "number", "default"
};


let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
    alert(`hint: ${hint}`);
    return hint == "string" ? `{name: "${this.name}"}` : this.money;
  }
};

// conversions demo:
alert(user); // hint: string -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // hint: default -> 1500

if there is not Symbol.toPrimitive then the js will try to find the tostring 
or the valueOf method. 

- for the string hint call the toString method, and if it does not exist or if it 
  returns the object instead of the primitive value, then call the valueOf

- for the other hints, call valueOf if it does not exist or returns the object 
  instead of the primitive value then call the toString()

If they both returns an object then they all will be ignored. 
By default, a plain object has following toString and valueOf methods:
The toString method returns a string "[object Object]".
The valueOf method returns the object itself.

let user = {name: "John"};
alert(user); // [object Object]
alert(user.valueOf() === user); // true

Instead of the Symbol.toPrimitive we can also make use of the toString or 
the valueOf method for the same. 
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  // for hint="string"
  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}"}`;
  },

  // for hint="number" or "default"
  valueOf() {
    return this.money;
  }

};

alert(user); // toString -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // valueOf -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // valueOf -> 1500



let user = {
  name: "John",

  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};
alert(user); // toString -> John
alert(user + 500); // toString -> John500

NOTE : 
In the absence of Symbol.toPrimitive and valueOf, toString will handle all 
primitive conversions.

The important thing here is that this conversion method should not necessary return 
the value according to the hint, hint number can also return string, but the thing 
is they should return the primitve not the object. 

let obj = {
  // toString handles all conversions in the absence of other methods
  toString() {
    return "2";
  }
};

alert(obj * 2); // 4, object converted to primitive "2", then multiplication 
made it a number

alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"
alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"

NOTE:
Just remember that the valueOf returns the object itself. so remember in case 
of the error messages. 


** Property flags and descriptors **
Object properties besides the value have three special attributes, which 
are called flags. 

- writable - if true the value can be changed otherwise read only 
- enumerable - if true then listed in loops 
- configurable - of true the property can be deleted and the attributes can be 
                 modified otherwise not

By default for the property these flags are always true. 

we have to make use of the property Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj,propertyname)
allows to query the full information about the property. 

obj = the object for get the information from 
propertyName = the name of the property 

returned value is the property descriptor, it contains the value and all the flags
information.


let user = {
  name: "John"
};

let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');
alert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );
/* property descriptor:
{
  "value": "John",
  "writable": true,
  "enumerable": true,
  "configurable": true
}
*/


for changing the flags we have to use the method Object.defineProperty()

Object.defineProperty(obj,propertyName,descriptor)
property descriptor object to apply 

if the property already exists then the define property will updates the flag 
otherwise it creates the property with the given value and flags, if the 
flag is not specified then it will be assumed false. 

let user = {};
Object.defineProperty(user, "name", {
  value: "John"
});
let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');
alert( JSON.stringify(descriptor, null, 2 ) );
/*
{
  "value": "John",
  "writable": false,
  "enumerable": false,
  "configurable": false
}
 */

if writable false = the property will not be changed.

errors will only be shown in the strict mode. 

Normally, a built-in toString for objects is non-enumerable, it does not 
show up in for..in. But if we add a toString of our own, then by default it 
shows up in for..in, like this:

et user = {
  name: "John",
  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};
// By default, both our properties are listed:
for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, toString

let user = {
  name: "John",
  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};
Object.defineProperty(user, "toString", {
  enumerable: false
});
// Now our toString disappears:
for (let key in user) alert(key); // name

NOTE : Non enumerable properties are also excluded from the Object.keys()

the non configurable property can not be modified or deleted.

NOTE :
configurable false prevents the changes of property flags and its deletion,
while allowing to change its value. 

THE ONLY ALLOWED CHANGE OF THE PROPERTY FLAG IS WRITABLE 
we can change the writable property flag from true to false and all.
Here when we pre define the property in the objects then it will be taken as the true 
but if we define them by defineProperty then it will be taken as the false. 


we can make use of the Object.defineProperties(obj,{
  prop1:descriptor1,
  prop2:descriptor2,
})

Object.defineProperties(user, {
  name: { value: "John", writable: false },
  surname: { value: "Smith", writable: false },
  // ...
});

together with the object.defineProperties() it can be used to flag aware clonning 

let clone = Object.defineProperties({}, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj));

when we clone the object normaly then we do not clone the flags
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key]
} in this case

also the for in traversal does not include the symbolic and non enumerable 
properties but the oBJECT.getOwnPropertyDescriptors returns all the property 
descriptors symbolic and all non enumerable ones also. 




** Object getters and setter **
There are two types of properties in objects, one is data property and the 
second is the accessor property. They are essentially the functions that executes 
on getting or setting the value. 

let obj = {
  get propName() {
    // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName
  },

  set propName(value) {
    // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value
  }
};



let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  },

  set fullName(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  }
};

// set fullName is executed with the given value.
user.fullName = "Alice Cooper";

alert(user.name); // Alice
alert(user.surname); // Cooper

descriptros for the accessor properties are different from those of the data 
properties. for the accessor properties there is no value or writable but there 
will be get and set functions. 

get – a function without arguments, that works when a property is read,
set – a function with one argument, that is called when the property is set,
enumerable – same as for data properties,
configurable – same as for data properties.

so for the instance for the creation of the accessor property fullName with the 
define property method we have to pass the descriptor object with the get and the 
set method. 

let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};
Object.defineProperty(user, 'fullName', {
  get() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  },

  set(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  }
});

alert(user.fullName); // John Smith
for(let key in user) alert(key); // name, surname


CONVENTION NOTE:
There is the smarter convention that the properties which has the name starting with 
the _ should not be touched from the outside world. 

we can declare smart getters and setters for having more control over the properties.

let user = {
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },

  set name(value) {
    if (value.length < 4) {
      alert("Name is too short, need at least 4 characters");
      return;
    }
    this._name = value;
  }
};

user.name = "Pete";
alert(user.name); // Pete
user.name = ""; // Name is too short...

>> Better usecase 

let say we have the user object and we are storing the name and the bdate what 
if we want the age we can create the smart getter and we can have the age property 
as the getter, not the setter it is not the smart way.

function User(name, birthday) {
  // this = {}
  this.name = name;
  this.birthday = birthday;

  // age is calculated from the current date and birthday
  Object.defineProperty(this, "age", {
    get() {
      let todayYear = new Date().getFullYear();
      return todayYear - this.birthday.getFullYear();
    }
  });

  // return this;
}

let john = new User("John", new Date(1992, 6, 1));
alert( john.birthday ); // birthday is available
alert( john.age );      // ...as well as the age



** Prototypical inheritance **

[[Protoype]]
In javascript OBJECTS have the special property named [[Protoype]] which is either 
null or reference to the another object. 

the [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but we can set in some ways. 
one is to use the special name __proto__.


let animal = {
  eats: true
};
let rabbit = {
  jumps: true
};
rabbit.__proto__ = animal; // sets rabbit.[[Prototype]] = animal

so it creates a sort of hierarchy, where if the property is not in the rabbit then 
it will be taken from the animal. here the rabit is inheriting from the animal. 


let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    alert("Animal walk");
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
  __proto__: animal
};

// walk is taken from the prototype
rabbit.walk(); // Animal walk


Limitations in the __proto__
1. The reference can not go in the circular fashion 
2. the value of the __proto__ can either be null or it can be object, other values 
   are ignored. 

NOTE:
there can be only one [[Prototype]]. An object may not inherit from two others.

Here the __proto__ is not the same as the [[Prototype]] property, the __proto__ is
basically the getter and setter for the [[prototype]]

Here the __proto__ is not recommended, we should make use of the 
Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf()

__proto__ is only for the reading, not for the writing. 

>> the value of this in the prototypes 
this is not affected by the prototypes at all.
No matter where the method is found, in an object or the prototype the this will 
always be the object before the dot. 

All the object has the final prototype as the Object.prototype. 

NOTE
Even if we have the setter and getter function which uses the this, they will 
always take the current child as the this, if the reading is happening then 
first it will check the current and then the proto, for writing also the same. 

Object.keys() = this only returns the own keys 
for in loop first returns own keys then the prototype

obj.hasOwnProperty(key) = returns true if it is own else false

any object has the by default prototype Object.prototype, in which the items are 
always not enumerable.


**** F.prototype ****
we can create the function object with the help of the new F syntax, and 
F.prototype is an object the new operator uses it to set the [[Prototype]]
for the new object. 

here the F.prototype is the regular property named prototype. but when we set 
this to some object the new operator will initialize the [[prototype]] of the 
object literal to the given set one. 


let animal = {
  eats: true
};

function Rabbit(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Rabbit.prototype = animal;
let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit"); //  rabbit.__proto__ == animal
alert( rabbit.eats ); // true

F.prototype is used at the new F only. 

if after the creation, F.prototype property changes to another object,
then new objects created by new F will have another object as [[Prototype]]
but already existing one keep the old one. 

if we do not supply the prototype property to the function, the default prototype 
is an object which only has the constructor property that point back to the 
function itself. 

function Rabbit() {}
/* default prototype
Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit };
*/


function Rabbit() {}
// by default:
// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }
alert( Rabbit.prototype.constructor == Rabbit ); // true


function Rabbit() {}
// by default:
// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }
let rabbit = new Rabbit(); // inherits from {constructor: Rabbit}
alert(rabbit.constructor == Rabbit); // true (from prototype)



function Rabbit(name) {
  this.name = name;
  alert(name);
}
let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit");
let rabbit2 = new rabbit.constructor("Black Rabbit");


if we give the custom prototype then the default prototype object 
will get overwritten.

function Rabbit() {}
Rabbit.prototype = {
  jumps: true
};
let rabbit = new Rabbit();
alert(rabbit.constructor === Rabbit); // false


If we want to keep the right constructor what we can do is, we can just update the 
default prototype.

Rabbit.prototype = {
  jumps: true,
  constructor: Rabbit
};
// now constructor is also correct, because we added it


NOTE:
all the writing operations are done in the object itself, not in the prototype 
so if we delete property from the prototype using the object then it will 
not delete it. 


the function syntax has the Prototype, while the object literal has the 
__proto__.

Object ---------Prototype-----> Object.prototype an object 
                                which consists of toString and 
                                other methods 



                                Object literal (whose __proto__ is 
                                Object.prototype)

    
let obj = {};
alert(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
alert(obj.toString === obj.__proto__.toString); //true
alert(obj.toString === Object.prototype.toString); //true

alert(Object.prototype.__proto__); // null


when we create some array objects or some other objects then by default the 
new Array() is used internally, and the Array.prototype is put as the __proto__
of the array literal.  The main root proto is the Object.prototype. 

Change in the native properties, is only allowed in the case of the pollyfilling. 
function User(){
    this.name = "user"
}
console.dir(User.__proto__ == Function.prototype) // true 

The prototype property is just for the initializing the __proto__ of the objects. 


for printing the inheritance we have to make use of the 
console.dir(object) it will list all the protos and all. 

f.__proto__ is same as Function.prototype 

when we call the properties on the primitives, they will be accessible from their 
wrappers, so each primitive has the prototype as the Array.prototype

NOTE:
null and undefined has no wrappers. 

we can also add some properties to String.prototype then it will be available to 
all the string literals. it is not recommended though, it is only allowed in the 
case of the pollyfilling. 

we can also do the method borrowing, so we take the method from the 
other prototype and then we can put it not the object and we can call it directly. 


let obj = {
  0: "Hello",
  1: "world!",
  length: 2,
};
obj.join = Array.prototype.join;
alert( obj.join(',') ); // Hello,world!


Function.prototype.defer = function(ms) {
  setTimeout(this, ms);
};
function f() {
  alert("Hello!");
}
f.defer(1000); // shows "Hello!" after 1 sec


we can also create the wrapper funtction.
Function.prototype.defer = function(ms) {
  let f = this;
  return function(...args) {
    setTimeout(() => f.apply(this, args), ms);
  }
};

// check it
function f(a, b) {
  alert( a + b );
}

f.defer(1000)(1, 2); // shows 3 after 1 sec


Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) = return [[Prototype]]
Object.setPrototypeOf(obj,proto) = return [[Prototype]]


there is some special methods for creating the object which is.

Object.create(proto,[descriptors]) = it creates an empty object with the
given proto as [[Prototype]] and optional property descriptors. 


let animal = {
  eats: true
};
// create a new object with animal as a prototype
let rabbit = Object.create(animal); // same as {__proto__: animal}


let animal = {
  eats: true
};
let rabbit = Object.create(animal, {
  jumps: {
    value: true
  }
});
alert(rabbit.jumps); // true


this is the more powerful way of cloning the objects then the other for in.
let clone = Object.create(
  Object.getPrototypeOf(obj), Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj)
);



NOTE:
We can set the plain object __proto__, directly but we can not set it 
with the user given value.
