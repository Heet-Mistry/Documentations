The object keys can be only two primitive types
string or symbol type

Symbol = it is the unique identifier

let id = Symbol("some description")

Even if we create the symbol with the same descriptions, the symbols will be unique.

let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");
alert(id1 == id2); // false

So, to summarize, a symbol is a “primitive unique value” with an optional 
description. Let’s see where we can use them.


Here the symbols are differnt from the string, as they do not auto convert 
in the alert like functions. Let say, we do alert(some symbol) then it will 
give an error.

we have to explicitely convert it into the string with the toString method,
which will work.

alert(symbol.toString())

or we can also fetch the description here by doing symbolVar.description.

>> Hidden properties 
Symbols allows us to create some hidden properties inside the objects, that no other 
part of the code can directly access.

let user = { // belongs to another code
  name: "John"
};
let id = Symbol("id");
user[id] = 1;
alert( user[id] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key

As user objects belong to another codebase, it’s unsafe to add fields to them, 
since we might affect pre-defined behavior in that other codebase. However, 
symbols cannot be accessed accidentally. The third-party code won’t be aware of 
newly defined symbols, so it’s safe to add symbols to the user objects.

Here if we export some object which has the symbol key to another script then 
it will not have that symbol key displayed in another script, it will be hidden.

So we can add our symbol keys and the raw script can use their own keys,
both can not access that. 

Symbols will be skipped in the keys or for in. 

But in contrast the Object.assign() will copy all the normal and the symbol 
properties. 


Global symbols
sometimes we have to store the global symbols inside the global registry, for 
that we can make use of the for method. 

let id = Symbol.for("id") // if the sybol with the id does not exist then 
it will create it and if exist it will return it, if we access the same with the 
for syntax then both will be the same. 

we can also access the name of the global symbols, with the help of 
the Symbol.keyFor(some symbol) = this will give the name or the description 

NOTE 
These above methods only run on the, global symbols, it will not work on the 
local symbols. it will give undefined when we use them on that. 

there are some by default system symbols that, helps to work with specific 
cnditions. 

Symbol.toPrimitive = for conversion
