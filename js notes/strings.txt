strings in the javascript can be enclosed with the 
'' or "" or ``;

advantage of the `` is that we can have the multiline strings here.

\n = new line character 
\r = sometimes used inside the windows combined with teh \r\n for the 
new break
\t = tab 
\' \" = for quotes

\ is called the escape character.

str.length = for the length of the string
str[0] = works for fetching the character at the specific index returns undefined for unbound
str.charAt(index) = for fetching the character at the index == returns '' for unbound

for iterating we can make use of the for of.

strings are immutable in javascript we can change the whole string but we 
can not change the specific character there.

str.toLowerCase()
str.toUpperCase()
str.indexOf(substr,pos) = returns -1 elsewise
str.lastIndexOf(substr,pos)
str.includes(substr,pos)
str.startsWith(substr)
str.endsWith(substr)
str.slice(start,end)
str.substr(start,length) = returns the substring from the start with given length
str.trim() = for removing the spaces from the beginning and the end

uppercase ASCII = 65 to 90 
lowerCase ASCII = 97 to 122 
0 to 9 = 48 to 57
> A lowercase letter is always greater than the uppercase



NOTE : ~2 = -(2+1)
