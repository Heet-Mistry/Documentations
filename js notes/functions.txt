*** Funtions in javascript ***
1. function declaration 
   function funcname(args){func body}
   function funcname(arg1,arg2=something){} ==> function with the default body

if we require the parameter inside the function declaration and we do not 
pass it in the function calling then we can explicitely check it for the 
undefined because when we do not pass the parameters it will be taken as the 
undefined.

return; ==> void return
when we do not have the return type of the function then it will return the 
undefined there.
the values passed into the function as parameters are copied to its local 
variables.


2. function expression 
let somevar = function(params){
  function body
}

In the javascript any function is the value itself when we use function 
declaration or the function expressions it does not matter it will be the 
same thing just the difference is in the hoisting. Also at the end of the 
function expression we require the semicolon because it is the part of the 
statement, when we use the function expression then we have to put the 
semicolon at the end.

callbacks function in the javascript is nothing but for imposing some sort of the 
order in the execution as let say if something happens we should do this and 
if not we should do something else.

The main difference between the function expression and the function declaration 
is that the function expression is created when the code flow reaches there 
and also it is useful after that only. But in the case of the function 
declaration when the javascript first executes the script at first it will check 
for the global declaration of the functions and then create it. so this 
functions will be available every time. Function declaration in the javascript 
is block scoped.

3. IIFE = Immediately invoked function expression 
(function(){
  some computations;
})(); // this thing will run automatically when it is reached



*** Arrow functions ***
Same as the function expressions the arrow function will not be hoisted in js.
Arrow functions should not be used to declare the methods in the object 
when we use the this otherwise it is fine.We have to use the function expression 
then.

let a = (args)=>{function body}
let a = ()=>something we want to return
