HTML = The language for the structure of the web 
CSS = The language for styling the webpages 
Js = The language for making the websites interactive 

The browser implementation of the javascript is called the ECMASCRIPT. It is 
not the language but it is the specification for the browser that how the js 
should be interpreted.

Node.js = it is the javascript server runtime to runt he javascript anywhere 
we want. ESLint is used for checking the spell check and for making sure 
that we are using and following the proper conventions and for linting.

> window.document = it will give the whole document in the console. Here the 
document is the whole HTML file.

Scripting language do not need compilation process, they are directly ran and executed 
javascript is interpreted language.

Inside the HTML markup we can insert the javascript by inserting the <script> tag when the 
browser will reach the strcipt tag it will execute the script inside it. also the single script 
tag can not contain both the src attribute and the inside code.

NOTE = The variables will be passed as the value in the javascript but the 
arrays will be passed as the reference by default. Objects also. Strings will 
also be passed as the value not the reference. 

Always put the script tag at the end of the HTML tags because when the browser 
will hit the script tag it will stop rendering other things and it will run 
the script. this is called the content blocking.

> async and defer in script tag 
async = it will download the script parallely but it will run as soon as the 
script is downloaded.

defer = this tag tells the browser that download the script parallely from 
the server but does not run it until the HTML doc is fully done
<script src="main.js" defer></script>

when we have the modules in the javascript always make sure tu put their types to the 
type=module as the browser will automaticaly defer this tags and then also they will first all get loaded
and due to the defer they will be executed at the end.
<script type="module> src=file1.js>
<script type="module> src=file2.js>
Here in the modules if we have one or more modules and one main module is 
importing the functionalities of other modules then we just have to include the 
main module.


There are total three ways to insert the js inside the website.
1. Internal js  = it is written in the script tag in the HTML file itself
2. Inline js = in script tag inside the html element
3. External js (script tag with the src)

internal means anywhere written js inside the <script> tag, where the inline 
is the js written in the html tag such as onclick and all. and the external js 
is the separate file included in the document. 


'use strict' directive tells the browser that the script should be run in the 
modern way, it should be on the top of the script file otherwise it will be 
ignored, we can also make a separate 
function strict, but it is not the useful usecase. 

The modern javascript supports the uses of classes and the modules, which by default 
enables the use strict, so we can omit the use strict on the top of the script file.
