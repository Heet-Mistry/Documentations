Evrything in the javascript runs or executes inside the execution context. it is
like the big box which has two parts memory (variable environment) where all 
the variables are stored as the key:value pair. also the functions.

The second component is called the code component ( thread of execution ) where 
the whole code will be executed one line at a time.

Javascript is the synchronou single threaded language. it means that javascript 
can only execute one command at a time and it can only execute them in the order.

*** How the js program runs ***
when the js script runs first it will create the global execution context. also 
this execution context is created in two phases first is the memory creation phase.
In the memory creation phase js will only allocate the memory to the variables 
it will not store their values first it will store the undefined there. In case 
of the functions it will store the whole code.

after that in the second phase (code execution phase) when the line by line execution will happen, 
the values will be assigned to the variables, and when we encounter the 
function call then what will happen is that there will be created one nested 
execution context, for the function.

what happens in the call stack is that when we create the GEC then it will be 
pushed in the stack and when the new function runs, then it will push that 
exectuion context there.



*** Hoisting in javascript ***
Hoisting is the phenomena in the javascript by which we can 
access those variables even before we have declared them. Hoisting lies 
inside the memory creation phase.

Even before the code starts executing the memory will be allocated to the 
variables and functions.

so what happens is in the memory creation phase the variables are being 
allocated the memory and then we can access them, though they are not given 
the value. so they will be undefined, where the function will store the whole 
code so it can be executed.

function declaration == hoisted 
function expression, arrow function == not hoisted 

Because in the case of the function expression and arrow function what we do
is we store the function as the variable so in the memory creation phase 
they will be undefined so we can not call the function which is undefined.
