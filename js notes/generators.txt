Generators allows us to return multiple values. 

function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  return 3;
}

when the function is called then it will not return the value, or run the code 
rather it will return the special generator object. 

if we want to run the code then we have to make use of the next method, here what 
the next method will do is, it will return an object which has the value which 
is yield and the done flag if true the function code is finished. 

the generators are the iterables. 
function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  return 3;
}

let generator = generateSequence();

for(let value of generator) {
  alert(value); // 1, then 2
}

as the generators are the iterables we can make use of the spread operator here. 
function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

let sequence = [0, ...generateSequence()];

alert(sequence); // 0, 1, 2, 3
