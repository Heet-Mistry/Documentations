Map is the key-value data type just like the object but the main difference 
here is that it can allow any type of keys here.

new Map() = creates the map 
map.set(ley,value) = stores the key value
map.get(key) = returns the value and if not exist then undefined 
map.has(key) = returns true if key exis else false 
map.delete(key) = removes the value by the key 
map.size = gives the size 
map.clear() = clear the whole map 

general object converts the key into the string, but map keeps the type so it is
different in that way.

every map.set call returns the map itself so we can use the chaining 
map.set(x,a).set(a,c)

map.keys() = returns the keys of the map
map.values() = returns the iterable of values
map.entries() = returns the iterable [key,value]

for let [k,v] of map.entries() it is the same as the for let[k,v] of mp
for let k of mp.keys()

map.forEach((value,key,mp)=> some computation)

for initializing the map we can make use of new Map() where we can pass 
the 2D array consisting of key and value pair 

let mp = new Map([[1,2],[3,4]])

if we have the object then we have to make use of the Object.entries(obj)


Also we can create the object with the help of the Object.fromEntries([[]])
it will create the object


when we have the map and then we want to convert it into the object then 
we can do it by doing like 

let obj = Object.fromEntries(map.entries());
