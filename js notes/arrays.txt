*** Arrays ***
We can declare the array by using the constructor syntax or the premitive syntax.
let arr = []
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [1,2,3,"fruits"]

arr.length = returns the length of the array 

if we want to fetch the last element of the array then we can not directly give 
the negative indexing arr[-1] like that we have to give it by doing like 
arr.at(-1)

arr.push(val) = it will append the elements at the end 
arr.shift() = it will remove the first element of the array and returns it
arr.pop() = it will remove the element from the end of the array 
arr.unshift(val) = it adds the element at the front of the array 

Array in the javascript is also the object. and it is the contigous memory location.
we can also add the property in teh arrays like arr.propname = some value;

we can traverse the array like 
for(let item of array){
  do something;
}

for(let key in array){
  arr[key]
}

if we change the array.length property explicitely then the values in there will 
also be changed.

let arr = new Array("a",1,2)
let arr = new Array(num) ==> it will create the new array of length num 

when we do something on the array then first it will be converted into the string 
[] ==> ""
[1] ==> "1"
[1,2] ==> "1,2"

[] +1 ==> "1"

when we compare the premitives then they will automatically typecasted to the type 
until they are not equal typed.

0 == [] ==> [] ==> "" ==> 0 // true 
'0' == [] ==> [] ==> "" != "0" //false 

we should not compare the arrays with the direct == operation we have to 
check the values elementwise.


*** Array methods ***
arr.push(item) = add the item at the end 
arr.pop() = extract the item from the end 
arr.shift() = extract the item from the beginning 
arr.unshift() = add item at the beginning

arrays are the objects also for deleting the item we can make use of the 
delete operator there, like 
delete arr[1];

but here when we do this the arr[1] will be deleted but the length of the array 
will remain the same, just that item will be undefined because the delete operator 
deletes the item by the key.

arr.splice(start,deletecnt,elem1,elem2)==> it deletes the array items from the 
start index till the deletecnt and then inserts the elem1 and elem2 ... there.

NOTE : In the splice the negative indexing is allowed.it will count from the end

arr.slice(start,end) ==> returns the array copy including item [start,end)
arr.slice() = it will copy the whole array
arr.concat(arg1,arg2) = here the arg1 and arg2 can be array or values it will 
concatenate with teh arr and returns the new concatanated array

arr.forEach((item,index,array)=>{
    // do something with the item 
});

// here the indexof follows the strict equality === comparisons 
// also the includes method handles the NaN where the indexOf can not
arr.indexOf(item,from) = returns the index if not found then -1
arr.lastIndexOf(item,from) = search from the right to left
arr.includes(item,from) = return true or false

let a = arr.find((item,index,arr)=> some bool condition) = the iterations is stopped 
when the truth condition happends the the value is returned if not 
undefined is returned

arr.findIndex(func) = > it returns the index where the element is found if not -1
arr.findLastIndex(func) = > search from the right to left

let res = arr.filter(func) ==> returns the filtered items 


let res = arr.map((item,index,arr)=>
    // return the new value changed value 
)

arr.sort(func) => it sorts the array inplace changing its element order but 
here there will be some ambiguity in the output because the array will be 
by default sorted as the string, for default behaviour we have to pass the 
compare function 

function compare(a,b){
    if(a>b) return 1;
    if(a==b) retur 0;
    if(a<b) return -1; // negative means does not change
}

arr.reverse() = reverse the array 

let arr = string.split(separator,maxsplitcnt);
when the seperator is '' it will split into the characters.

let str = arr.join('join operaotr')

reduce and reduce right 
this methods are helpful for calculating the single values based on the array 
computation.

let value = arr.reduce((accumulator,item,index,arr)=>{
},[initial])


// example
// here if we do not give the initial value then the reducer will automatically 
// take the first value of the array as the initial value
// same as the reduce the reduceright go from the right to the left
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let result = arr.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);
alert(result); // 15


// Array.isArray()
arrays are also the objects in the javascript so typeof operator does not 
help to distinguish between the types we have to make use of the 
array.isArray()

alert(typeof {}); // object
alert(typeof []); // object (same)

alert(Array.isArray({})); // false
alert(Array.isArray([])); // true
