In general times we sometimes pass the props to the child components from the 
parent component, but sometimes it can become too much verbose when we have to 
pass the props too much deeply.

We can make use of the context for this case as it is easy, the context creates 
some information and makes it available to the child components no matter how 
much deep they are. 

Sometimes in the UI tree, it can be the situation where when we pass the props, 
it becomes the situation where, we have to pass those props to the very independent 
components, even if they do not need them, till we reach the desired component. 
This is called the "prop drilling".

Context basically lets the parent to create some information and it will be 
available to its child no matter how deeply they are. 

# Step 1
we have to create the context file from where we will export the context, so that 
our components can use them.

// LevelContext.js
import { createContext } from 'react';
export const LevelContext = createContext(1);

The argument to the createContext is the default value of the context. 

Then we have to make use of the useContext hook for fetching the context. So
basicaly the useContext hook tells the react that it wants to use some context. 

import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

export default function Heading({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  // ...
}


So first we have to create the context with some default value, after that, let say 
we have a component section which provides its components some props, then we have 
to wrap the children of the section component with the context provider, and give the 
value we want as the props of the context provider, and after that when we use the 
usecontext hook in the children it will take its closest context provider, and 
get that value. 


// section.js 
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';
export default function Section({ level, children }) {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}


// Heading.js 
export default function Heading({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  switch (level) {
    case 1:
      return <h1>{children}</h1>;
    case 2:
      return <h2>{children}</h2>;
    case 3:
      return <h3>{children}</h3>;
    case 4:
      return <h4>{children}</h4>;
    case 5:
      return <h5>{children}</h5>;
    case 6:
      return <h6>{children}</h6>;
    default:
      throw Error('Unknown level: ' + level);
  }
}



Here we can also make use of the context as like we can use and provide the 
context from the same component. 


// App.js 
import Heading from './Heading.js';
import Section from './Section.js';
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Section>
      <Heading>Title</Heading>
      <Section>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Heading>Heading</Heading>
        <Section>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Heading>Sub-heading</Heading>
          <Section>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
            <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading>
          </Section>
        </Section>
      </Section>
    </Section>
  );
}

// Section.js 
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';
export default function Section({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}


// Heading.js 
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';
export default function Heading({ children }) {
  const level = useContext(LevelContext);
  switch (level) {
    case 0:
      throw Error('Heading must be inside a Section!');
    case 1:
      return <h1>{children}</h1>;
    case 2:
      return <h2>{children}</h2>;
    case 3:
      return <h3>{children}</h3>;
    case 4:
      return <h4>{children}</h4>;
    case 5:
      return <h5>{children}</h5>;
    case 6:
      return <h6>{children}</h6>;
    default:
      throw Error('Unknown level: ' + level);
  }
}

import { createContext } from 'react';
export const LevelContext = createContext(0);


If there is no provider near in the UI tree then the useContext will take the 
default value given to the context. In react the context will go down deep 
as much as the children are, and if we want to change the context value then 
we have to wrap them into new context provider. 


We should first think when we use the context, we should not directly use them. 
There is nothing wrong in passin the props, it can be less error prone and more 
intuitive, also we should think what we are passing down in props, let say we 
pass the posts to the layout component, but it does not make any sense, rather we 
shoudl pass them as a children props. <Layout>{children}</Layout>, we should 
extract the components when needed. 


Context is not limited to the static values. If you pass a different value on the 
next render in the context provider, then the react will update all the components 
reading it below, so the context can be used with the state easily.
