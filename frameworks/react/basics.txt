React is the library for the UI development, it does not care about the routing 
or the data management. 

with the minimal tool chain we can initialize the project with the following.
> npx create-react-app appname

package manager = it lets us install, update and manage the third party 
packages (yarn, npm)

bundler = a bundler lets you write the code in a modular way and bundle it 
together into small packages to optimize the load time.

minifier = it makes the code more compact so that it can load faster.

linter = this checks the code for the common mistakes. 


## React without the toolchain 
root is the element where the react tree will begin. 

In the html we have to add a script cdn files, for react development and 
react-dom development.

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(element)
root.render(React.createElement(component or element,props,children))

so rect basically creates the root and then make use of the append child method 
for adding the children components. 

so basically when we implement the react without the toolchain then we have to 
add this extra code manually, we have to install babel for runing the JSX and all.

so rather we should make use of the react toolchain npx.


NOTE ==
ReactDOM.render(WHAT TO RENDER, WHERE TO RENDER)
root.render(react node)

ReactDOM is the api to manipulate with the DOM and updating it.
