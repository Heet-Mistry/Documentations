React component renders when there is initial render or there is a state change 
in one of its ancestor parents. 

Rendering is basically react calling the component. 

>>>> Render and commit 
1. Trigger the render 
2. Rendering 
3. Commit the render 

for the initial render the react uses appendChild() for the DOM API to 
update the DOM. For the re renders react will apply minimal necessary operations.

After the rendering the browser will paint the screen. Rendering basically 
takes the snapshot in the time. State generally works as the snapshot of the UI 
in the time. When we set state only changes when the next render. 

<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
}}>+3</button>

this will update the state to 1 not 3.


When we trigger a new render it will first execute the current lines 
of code which is remaining and then it will try to trigger the re render. React keeps 
the state values fixed within one render's event handlers. 


When we set the state variable it will queue another render, but sometimes we might
want to perform the multiple operations on the value before queuing the next render.
React batches the state updates. 

React does not batch across multiple events like clicks but each event handlers 
are handled seperately. 

updater function when passed will only consider the updated state value of that 
UI snapshot, while the simple state change will not consider the updated value
while it will take that render's state value. 

number =0;
setNumber(number=>number+1) // number = 1
setNumber(number+1) // number =1 

number =0;
setNumber(number+1) // number =1 
setNumber(number=>number+1) // number = 2

and when we replace the state change with just a value everything will be 
replaced and the state value will be that one single value. Here the updater 
function should be pure as they are ran during the rendering. 



>> Managing state
Tips for removing duplicate state variables 
1. Does this state cause paradox = any non determining UI state 
2. remove redundant state variables 
3. we can determine some state based on other states 

It is not recommended to mirror the props into the states 
like because what if the parent will pass some different prop, 
then the UI will not change here. 

function someComp({prop}){
    let [var,setVar] = useState(prop);
}

if we want to share the states between two components then we have to 
make use of the lift the state up into their common parent component. 



>> Preserving and reseting the state 
React keeps track of which state belongs to which component based on their place
in the UI tree. 

State is tied to the position in the tree. React will keep the state around for 
as long as you render the same component at the same position. When the component 
unmounts then its state will be gone. 

React preserves the component's state as long as it is being rendered at the same 
position in the UI tree. If we render the same component at the same place then 
it will preserve the state. It is not the position inside the JSX but in the 
UI tree. 

When the state resets it will be resetted into all the sub tree down. 
 if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of 
 your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another. If the structure 
 is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it 
 removes a component from the tree.

we can reset the state of the compoent by giving unique keys to the components. 
keys are not globally unique they only specify the position within the parent. 


## Principles for chosing the state structure 
1. Grouping the related state = when two things change together 
2. Avoiding the contradicting state = when the UI becomes inconsistent in state 
3. Avoid redundant states = if we can calculate something from other thing 
4. Avoid duplication = we should not store the same or the partial state 
5. Avoid too much nesting of states = objects are not really that nested
