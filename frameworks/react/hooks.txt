Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is 
rendering (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). 
They let you “hook into” different React features.

Hooks can only be called on the top of the components they can not be 
called inside the nested blocks.

1. useState(initialState) == returns the stateful value and 
   a function to update the state.

- also the react ensures the setState function identity is stable 
and won't change on the rerenders. so it is safe to omit from 
the useEffect and useCallback deps list. 

- we can also pass the updater function inside the useState 

we can also pass the initial state as the lazy initial state 
resulting from the heavy computations. the initial state will only 
be conunted on the initial render, after that it will be disregared.

const [state, setState] = useState(() => {
  const initialState = someExpensiveComputation(props);
  return initialState;
});


when the state is not changed then the react will bail out from re rendering the 
childrens, but it has to render that component once to check, but iw will not be 
a problem because react will not go deeper in the tree. 

clicking a button twice and these are the updates that are handled 
seperately and do not get batched. 


2. useCallback() == this returns the memoized callback.
const memoizedcallback = useCallback(
    () => {
        doSomething(a,b);
    },
    [a,b],
);

it will return a memoized function that we passed in the argument,
it will only change its reference when the dependency list changes.

this is helpful when we are passing the functions to the child 
components and they are relying on the reference of the function 
to change something or rendering something.
(basically parent component creates the callback 
and then send it to the children and children has some useEffect 
and it will only run when the function changes)\


it is recommended to use the exhasutive-deps as the plugin in the eslint 
react hooks to auto fill the deps. 



3. useMemo(()=> some return value) == it is used for memoized 
heavy computation, where the function given inside the useMemo 
will only run again if the dependency changes and it will return 
the memoized value.

- the function passed inside the useMemo will run during the 
rendering so we should not include any side effects in useMemo 

- mostly write the code which does not include the use of useMemo

NOTE = Side effects does not belong to the useMemo they should be in 
the useEffect()


4. useEffect() == for introducing the side effects, basically it 
is mainly used for the data fetching when something changes.

Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not 
allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s 
render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in the 
UI.


useEffect(()=>{
  // this code will run when the component renders
  // everytime because we have not passed any dependency
},[]); // SO THIS IS FOR THE ONMOUNT EXECUTION

even if we give the dependency list, at the initial mount the useEffect will 
run because mainly we give the state as the dependency list, so 
at the first mount the state will go from nothing to something so still 
the useEffect will be executed.

Often in the useEffect we write some mutations, subscriptions and side effects 
so when the component leaves the screen they need to be cleaned, so for cleaning 
the effects it can return a cleanup function, that cleanup function will run 
when the next useEffect will run and that cleanup function will be in the context 
of the previous snapshot of the UI. 

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
  return () => {
    // Clean up the subscription
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
});


// defining the states 
const [resourceType, setResourceType] = useState('products');
const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  // useEffect for fetching the data
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://dummyjson.com/${resourceType}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => setItems(json[`${resourceType}`]));
  },[resourceType]);

  return (
    <>
      {console.log("component rendering...")}
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setResourceType('products')}>products</button>
        <button onClick={() => setResourceType('users')}>Users</button>
        <button onClick={() => setResourceType('comments')}>Comments</button>
      </div>
      <h1>{resourceType}</h1>
      {items.map((item, index) => 
        <p>{index} item is {JSON.stringify(item)}</p>
      )}
    </>
  );

So at first the component renders and then the useEffect will be called
, for visualizing the effect just add the setTimeOut inside the fetching 
data part of the useEffect and then see the rendering and then fetching.

useEffect also helps to add the event listeners to the page, or creating 
some custom hooks like, let say something like below. Here we have 
introdued the cleanup shown below, so we can see that when the next 
render will happen the useEffect cleanup will run. 

so basically after the render when the next useEffect will run first the 
cleanup will run and the cleanup will take the function which runs before 
the next useEffect.


const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  const handleResize = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("added the listener...")
    setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => {
      console.log("removed the listener...")
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    }
  }, [handleResize]);

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {windowWidth}
      </div>
    </>
  );


=====
components are unmounted when the parent component is no longer rendered or 
the parent component performs the update that does not render this instance.

useEffects run before the browser paint.
[] == means it will run only once 
nothing as the second argument == it will run everytime when the component 
renders



5. useRef() === 
let say we want to show how many times the component rendered. useRef when 
changed will not trigger the re render, it will return an object which has 
a field current which will be set to the initial value we gave to the 
ref hook.

The major usecase of the useRef hook is to reference the HTML element 
inside the jsx. Each and every element in the document has ref attribute 
we can set it to any ref.

the main usecase of the useRef is to focus on some input element, 

const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const inputRef = useRef();
  const focus = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}></input>
      <div>My name is {name}</div>
      <button onClick={focus}>Focus</button>
    </div>
  );

we can also store the previous value of the state inside the ref 

const prev = useRef('');
useEffect(()=>{
  prev.current = state;
},[state]); // because when the state changes the component will re render 
and then browser will be painted. so the content of the browser paint 
are generated and then the useEffect will run. so when the rendered content 
will be shown into the browser it will not paint the current value rather 
it will show the prev value. 

const inputRef = useRef();
<input ref={inputRef}/>


React.memo()
it is a higher order component provided by react to optimize the renders.
if the props does not change and the parent changes then the react will 
re render all the child in the depth tree, but when the we wrap the 
component in the memo then it will only renders if the UI changes, if the ref
equality changes and if the state changes of that component. 


NOTE 
React components renders if the state changes 
if the parent component renders then it will re render all of its childrens 
if the props changes
